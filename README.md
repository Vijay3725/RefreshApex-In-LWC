# RefreshApex-In-LWC

In this there are two components in which one is record form to create and edit entity records.
The other is a datatable component which is to show the status counts of entity object considering the latest status of the each entity record as records are updated.
The third is the parent component which handles the communication between the the other two components and displays both the re cord form and datatable to the users. 
Here the datatable gets automatically updated everytime a record is created or updated using the record form component
